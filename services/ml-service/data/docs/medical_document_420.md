## History of Present Illness
Ms. Smith, a 36-year-old female, presents for a follow-up regarding persistent fatigue and occasional palpitations. Symptoms started approximately 2 months ago, gradually worsening. Fatigue is constant, not relieved by rest. Palpitations occur sporadically, lasting a few seconds to a minute, described as 'skipped beats.' Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or syncope. No recent infections or significant stressors reported.

*   **Blood Pressure:** 130/85 mmHg
*   **Heart Rate:** 78 bpm
*   **Respiratory Rate:** 16 breaths/min
*   **Oxygen Saturation:** 98.0%

## Physical Exam
General: Well-appearing, no acute distress. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, S1/S2 audible, no murmurs/rubs/gallops. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema, good peripheral pulses. Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves intact, motor and sensory intact.

## Lab Results
Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) within normal limits. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) 3.2 mIU/L (normal range 0.4-4.0). Electrolytes normal. Lipid panel pending.

## Imaging Results
Electrocardiogram (ECG) performed in clinic showed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial contractions (PACs). No significant ST-T wave changes. Echocardiogram performed previously 6 months ago was normal.

## Diagnosis
*   **R53.82:** Chronic fatigue, unspecified
*   **I49.1:** Premature atrial depolarization
*   **I10:** Essential (primary) hypertension

## Treatment Plan
Continue current antihypertensive medication. Reassurance regarding PACs given the normal echocardiogram and benign nature. Recommend regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and ensuring adequate sleep for fatigue management. Follow-up lipid panel once results are available. Consider Holter monitor if palpitations become more frequent or symptomatic.

## Medications
*   **Lisinopril:** 10 mg, Once daily, Chronic
*   **Multivitamin:** 1 tablet, Once daily, Ongoing

## Follow-up Instructions
