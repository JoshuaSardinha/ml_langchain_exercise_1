## Treatment Plan

Patient advised to rest, increase fluid intake, and continue with over-the-counter cough suppressants as needed. Given the elevated CRP, a viral etiology is suspected, but bacterial infection not entirely ruled out. Will monitor symptoms.

## Follow-up Instructions

Follow up in 5-7 days or sooner if symptoms worsen (e.g., development of fever, shortness of breath, severe chest pain). If cough persists beyond 3 weeks or changes in character, consider re-evaluation and further investigations.
