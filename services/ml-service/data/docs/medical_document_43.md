Musculoskeletal: Mild tenderness on palpation of bilateral knees and shoulders. Full range of motion in all joints, but patient reports discomfort with extremes of motion. No significant effusions or erythema noted. Skin: Warm and dry, no rashes.

## Lab Results
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: Within normal limits.

## Diagnosis
*   **R53.82**: Chronic fatigue, unspecified

*   **R76.0**: Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) without other diagnosis

## Treatment Plan
1.  Refer to Rheumatology for further evaluation of positive ANA and chronic arthralgia/fatigue.
2.  Continue current antihypertensive medication.
3.  Suggest regular, low-impact exercise (e.g., walking, swimming).
4.  Recommend Vitamin D supplementation if levels are low (awaiting results).
5.  Pain management with Acetaminophen as needed for joint discomfort, limit NSAID use given GI history.

## Medications

    *   **Dosage**: 10 mg
    *   **Frequency**: Once daily
    *   **Duration**: Ongoing
*   **Acetaminophen**

    *   **Duration**: As needed

## Follow-up Instructions
Patient advised to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist. Follow-up with primary care in 4-6 weeks to review rheumatology recommendations and discuss Vitamin D results.

## Notes
Patient expressed concern about possible autoimmune condition. Reassured her that further specialist evaluation is necessary to confirm or rule out specific diagnoses. Discussed the non-specific nature of ANA positive results and the importance of clinical correlation.
